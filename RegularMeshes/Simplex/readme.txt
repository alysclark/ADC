This folder contains all the .exelem and .exnode files that are outputted by OpenCMISS when running a steady-state or time-dependent Simplex problem.
The steady-state simplex is very similar to the Laplace problem, except the interpolation type is changed to Simplex.
The time-dependent problem takes a similar format to the more complex meshes (stored in IdealisedMeshes) except that it has a cuboid mesh which was automatically generated by OpenCMISS.
