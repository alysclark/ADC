The perl file lets you find the average concentration across all the nodes for several time dependent problems, i.e. compare average concentration across mesh at 0.002 seconds and that at 0.004.
This lets you determine whether you have reached/approached steady state.
To run the perl file, just type perl FindAverage.pl
Make sure you have all the files you want to display the average of in the same file as the perl file.
